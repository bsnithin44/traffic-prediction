# traffic-prediction

I am using Google distance matrix API and Azure Functions to collect the traffic Data at few junctions in Bangalore.

What i am looking for is
1. Programatically determine input roads to a target road and predict the traffic on target road using input road features and compare it with the google prediction.

2. Correlation of traffic between different roads. If present any.

This is under development. Anyone willing to contribute is most welcome. I will be updating it soon, The API keys present in the repo are deactivated :).
